      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer with a passion for building clean, efficient,
        and user-focused solutions — especially in the health and fitness space.
        My background as a qualified gym instructor gives me a unique
        perspective on creating tech that helps people move better, live
        healthier, and reach their goals. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably
        find me running, lifting, or experimenting with new training methods.
        I’m always up for connecting with like-minded people, sharing ideas, and
        building something that makes a real impact.
