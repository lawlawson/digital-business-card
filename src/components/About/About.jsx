      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer with a passion for building clean, efficient,
        and user-focused solutions — especially in the health and fitness
        space.When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me running, lifting, or
        experimenting with new training methods. I’m always up for connecting
        with like-minded people, sharing ideas, and building something that
        makes a real impact.
